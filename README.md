# A breakdown of U.S. energy consumers

## I. Purpose of the research
:small_orange_diamond: To create an overarching typology of American households, based on their
energy usage patterns <br>
:small_orange_diamond: To identify the key beneficiaries of federal tax credits for clean energy and energy efficiency <br>
:point_right: in order to ensure an effective and equitable transition to net-zero emissions

<br> 

## II. Dataset
 :date: U.S. Energy Information Administration (2024). [Residential Energy Consumption Survey, 2020](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/index.php?view=microdata) <br>

## IV. Findings

<br> :notebook_with_decorative_cover::pencil2: For a detailed review, please refer to the [Summary Report](https://github.com/quinnei/Clustering-energy-usage/blob/main/4_Report/%5BREPORT%5D%20A%20breakdown%20of%20US%20energy%20consumers%20-%20From%20the%20gluttonous%20to%20the%20overladen.pdf)

<br> :small_orange_diamond: American households consist of four types: <br>
1) the **_polluting elite_** <br> :point_right: a major source of wasteful energy consumption, living in outsized homes despite small number of occupants 
2) the **_thrifty_** but **_energy-inefficient_** <br> :point_right: bear the hidden costs of energy-inefficiency, despite efforts to cut corners
3) the **_overburdened_** <br> :point_right: tend to spend large amounts on energy, due to draft and large number of occupants (that live in crowded housing)
5) the **_modest consumer_**

:small_orange_diamond: Downsizing is required on the part of the **_polluting elites_** <br> 
:small_orange_diamond: Federal energy efficiency programs should prioritize 1) the **_overburdened_** and 2) the **_thrifty_** but **_energy-inefficient_**
